/** Store a parallel numbering of Lobatto points of a given degree > 0.
 *
 * Each element has degree+1 nodes per face
 * and vnodes = (degree+1)^2 nodes per volume.
 * num_local_elements is the number of local quadrants in the p4est.
 * element_nodes is of dimension vnodes * num_local_elements
 * and indexes into the set of local nodes layed out as follows:
 * local nodes = [<-----owned_count----->|<-----nonlocal_nodes----->]
 *             = [<----------------num_local_nodes----------------->]
 * nonlocal_nodes contains the globally unique numbers for independent nodes
 * that are owned by other processes; for local nodes, the globally unique
 * numbers are given by i + global_offset, where i is the local number.
 * Hanging nodes are always local and don't have a global number.
 * They index the geometrically corresponding independent nodes of a neighbor.
 *
 * Whether nodes are hanging or not is decided based on the element faces.
 * This information is encoded in face_code with one int8_t per element.
 * If no faces are hanging, the value is zero, otherwise the face_code is
 * interpreted by p4est_lnodes_decode.
 *
 * Independent nodes can be shared by multiple MPI ranks.
 * The owner rank of a node is the one from the lowest numbered element
 * on the lowest numbered octree *touching* the node.
 *
 * What is meant by *touching*?
 * A quadrant is said to touch all faces/corners that are incident on it,
 * and by extension all nodes that are contained in those faces/corners.
 *
 *         X +-----------+
 *         o |           |
 *         o |           |
 * +-----+ o |     p     |
 * |  q  | o |           |
 * |     | o |           |
 * +-----+ O +-----------+
 *
 * In this example degree = 6.  There are 5 nodes that live on the face
 * between q and p, and one at each corner of that face.  The face is incident
 * on q, so q owns the nodes on the face (provided q is from a lower tree or
 * has a lower index than p).  The lower corner is incident on q, so q owns it
 * as well.  The upper corner is not incident on q, so q cannot own it.
 *
 * global_owned_count contains the number of independent nodes owned by each
 * process.
 *
 * The sharers array contains items of type p4est_lnodes_rank_t
 * that hold the ranks that own or share independent local nodes.
 * If there are no shared nodes on this processor, it is empty.
 * Otherwise, it is sorted by rank and the current process is included.
