 * \param [in] refloc   Eventually used for cubic and upwards degrees.
 *                      We will expect degree + 1 many values for the

 *                      The others default by symmetry considerations.
 * \param [in] geom     May be NULL for generating the tree-reference
 *                      coordinates, or a valid geometry object for
 *                      transforming the reference into mapped space.
 * \param [in,out] coordinates  On input, an array with entries of
 *                      3 double variables each.  Resized in this
 *                      function and populated with coordinate tuples.
 *                      With a NULL geometry, these are in [0, 1]**3.
 *                      Otherwise, they are mapped by the geometry.
 * \param [in,out] element_coordinates  This may be NULL, in which case
 *                      we generate one coordinate tuple for each lnode.
 *                      Otherwise, this must be an array with entries of

 *                      Its entries point into the coordinates array.
 *                      The tree index of any given entry is implicit
 *                      in that this array is derived from a p4est,
 *                      where sets of (degree + 1)**3 entries each
