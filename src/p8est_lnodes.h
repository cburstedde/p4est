/** Store a parallel numbering of Lobatto points of a given degree > 0.
 *
 * Each element has degree+1 nodes per edge
 * and vnodes = (degree+1)^3 nodes per volume.
 * element_nodes is of dimension vnodes * num_local_elements
 * and indexes into the set of local nodes layed out as follows:
 * local nodes = [<-----owned_count----->|<-----nonlocal_nodes----->]
 *             = [<----------------num_local_nodes----------------->]
 * nonlocal_nodes contains the globally unique numbers for independent nodes
 * that are owned by other processes; for local nodes, the globally unique
 * numbers are given by i + global_offset, where i is the local number.
 * Hanging nodes are always local and don't have a global number.
 * They index the geometrically corresponding independent nodes of a neighbor.
 *
 * Whether nodes are hanging or not is decided based on the element faces and
 * edges. This information is encoded in face_code with one int16_t per
 * element. If no faces or edges are hanging, the value is zero, otherwise the
 * face_code is interpreted by p8est_lnodes_decode.
 *
 * Independent nodes can be shared by multiple MPI ranks.
 * The owner rank of a node is the one from the lowest numbered element
 * on the lowest numbered octree *touching* the node.
 *
 * What is meant by *touching*?
 * A quadrant is said to touch all faces/edges/corners that are incident on it,
 * and by extension all nodes that are contained in those faces/edges/corners.
 *
 *            X      +-----------+
 *             x     |\           \
 *            x      | \           \
 *             . x   |  \           \
 *            x   X  |   +-----------+
 * +-----+     . .   |   |           |
 * |\     \   X   o  +   |           |
 * | +-----+   o .    \  |     p     |
 * + |  q  |      o    \ |           |
 *  \|     |     o      \|           |
 *   +-----+      O      +-----------+
 *
 * In this example degree = 3.  There are 4 nodes that live on the face
 * between q and p, two on each edge and one at each corner of that face.
 * The face is incident on q, so q owns the nodes marked '.' on the face
 * (provided q is from a lower tree or has a lower index than p).
 * The bottom and front edges are incident on q, so q owns its nodes marked
 * 'o' as well.
 * The front lower corner is incident on q, so q owns its node 'O' as
 * well.  The other edges and corners are not incident on q, so q cannot own
 * their nodes, marked 'x' and 'X'.
 *
 * global_owned_count contains the number of independent nodes owned by each
 * process.
 *
 * The sharers array contains items of type p8est_lnodes_rank_t
 * that hold the ranks that own or share independent local nodes.
 * If there are no shared nodes on this processor, it is empty.
 * Otherwise, it is sorted by rank and the current process is included.
