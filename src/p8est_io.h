 * All p4est data files have 64 bytes file header section at the beginning of the file.

 * (called string*) and is therefore readable in a text editor.
 *
 * File Header (96 bytes):
 * 7 bytes magic number (p8data0) and 1 byte new line char.
 * 23 bytes p4est version string* and 1 byte new line char.
 * 47 bytes user string*  and 1 byte new line char.
 * 16 bytes number of global quadrants.
 *
 * The file header section is padded by 16 bytes consisting of 1 byte
 * new line char succeeded by 14 bytes of spaces and 1 trailing byte
 * new line char.
 *
 * The actual data is stored in arrays corresponding to a mesh of a p4est
 * or in block sections that have a fixed user-defined size. The block
 * sections are written and read on rank 0.
 * One data field stores a fixed number of bytes of user-
 * defined data per quadrant of a certain p4est. Therefore, one user-defined
 * data field is of the size p4est->global_num_quadrants * data_size, where
 * data_size is set by the user. The file format is partition independent.
 * The data fields are padded such that the number of bytes for
 * an array is divisible by 16. The padding also enforced for data blocks
 * that have a size that is divisble by 16.
 * The p4est data file consists of a variable number (including 0) of
 * these two types of data sections.
 * Every data section includes 64 bytes of section header written at the beginning
 * by p4est. These 64 bytes are again written to the file as string* and can
 * be read using a text editor.
 *
 * Data section Header (64 bytes):
 * One byte data section type specific character (B for a block section and F for
 * a data field), 1 byte space and 13 bytes size in number of bytes for a
 * block section and data size per element in byte for a field section
 * and one trailing byte new line char.
 * 47 bytes user-defined string* and 1 byte new line char.
 *
 * The structure of p4est and p8est data files differs only by the magic number.
 *
 * The p4est metadata of a p4est data file can be accessed by \ref p8est_file_info().
