/** \file p4est_search.h
 * Search through quadrants, the local part of a forest, or the partition.
 *
 * This file provides several helper functions and a couple highlevel
 * recursive search algorithms.  These can be used to search for a collection
 * of user-defined "points" through the forest.  There are three flavors of
 * the main search algorithm:
 *
 * 1. \ref p4est_search_local
 *
 *    This function examines the processor-local part of the refinement tree.
 *    It proceeds top-down along all subtrees that have at least one local leaf.
 *    Non-local subtrees are ignored in an optimized way.  Use this function to
 *    compare points against the local branches and leaves.
 *
 * 2. \ref p4est_search_partition
 *
 *    This function examines the parallel partition that is known to all
 *    processors without knowing about actual leaves on remote processors.
 *    Use this to find the processors relevant for a collection of points,
 *    which can then be used to send each point to its assigned processor.
 *
 * 3. \ref p4est_search_all
 *
 *    This function combines the first two into one algorithm.  Note that when
 *    the parallel partition is not of interest, \ref p4est_search_local is
 *    recommended instead since it employs optimizations that are only possible
 *    on the local processor.

/** Search through the local part of a forest.
 *
 * The search is especially efficient if multiple targets, called "points"
 * below, are searched for simultaneously.
 *
 * The search runs over all local quadrants and proceeds recursively top-down.
 * For each tree, it may start at the root of that tree, or further down at the
 * root of the subtree that contains all of the tree's local quadrants.
 * Likewise, some intermediate levels in the recursion may be skipped if the
 * processor-local part is contained in a single deeper subtree.
 * The outer loop is thus a depth-first, processor-local forest traversal.
 * Each quadrant in that loop either is a leaf, or a (direct or indirect)
 * strict ancestor of a leaf.  On entering a new quadrant, a user-provided
 * quadrant-callback is executed.
 *
 * As a convenience, the user may provide anonymous "points" that are tracked
 * down the forest.  This way one search call may be used for multiple targets.
 * The set of points that potentially matches a given quadrant diminishes from
 * the root down to the leaves:  For each quadrant, an inner loop over the
 * potentially matching points executes a point-callback for each candidate
 * that determines whether the point may be a match.  If not, it is discarded
 * in the current branch, otherwise it is passed to the next deeper level.
 * The callback is allowed to return true for the same point and more than one
 * quadrant; in this case more than one matching quadrant may be identified.
 * The callback is also allowed to return false for all children of a quadrant
 * that it returned true for earlier.  If the point callback returns false for
 * all points relevant to a quadrant, the recursion stops.
 * The points can really be anything, p4est does not perform any
 * interpretation, just passes the pointer along to the callback function.
 *
 * If points are present and the first quadrant callback returned true, we
 * execute it a second time after calling the point callback for all current
 * points.  This can be used to gather and postprocess information about the
 * points more easily.  If it returns false, the recursion stops.
 *
 * If the points are a NULL array, they are ignored and the recursion proceeds
 * by querying the per-quadrant callback.  If the points are not NULL but an
 * empty array, the recursion will stop immediately!
 *
 * \param [in] p4est        The forest to be searched.
 * \param [in] call_post    If true, call quadrant callback both pre and post
 *                          point callback, in both cases before recursion (!).
 * \param [in] quadrant_fn  Executed once when a quadrant is entered, and once
 *                          when it is left (the second time only if points are
 *                          present and the first call returned true).
 *                          This quadrant is always local, if not completely
 *                          then at least one descendant of it.  If the
 *                          callback returns false, this quadrant and its
 *                          descendants are excluded from the search recursion.
 *                          Its \b point argument is always NULL.
 *                          Callback may be NULL in which case it is ignored.
 * \param [in] point_fn     If \b points is not NULL, must be not NULL.
 *                          Shall return true for any possible matching point.
 *                          If \b points is NULL, this callback is ignored.
 * \param [in] points       User-defined array of "points".
 *                          If NULL, only the \b quadrant_fn callback
 *                          is executed.  If that is NULL, this function noops.

/** Perform a top-down search on the whole forest.
 *
 * This function combines the functionality of \ref p4est_search_local and \ref
 * p4est_search_partition; their documentation applies for the most part.
 *
 * The recursion proceeds from the root quadrant of each tree until
 * (a) we encounter a remote quadrant that covers only one processor, or
 * (b) we encounter a local leaf quadrant.
 * In other words, we proceed with the recursion into a quadrant's children if
 * (a) the quadrant is split between two or more processors, no matter whether
 * one of them is the calling processor or not, or (b) if the quadrant is on
 * the local processor but we have not reached a leaf yet.
 *
 * The search can track one or more points, which are abstract placeholders.
 * They are matched against the quadrants traversed using a callback function.
 * The result of the callback function can be used to stop a recursion early.
 * The user determines how a point is interpreted, we only pass it around.
 *
 * Note that in the remote case (a), we may terminate the recursion even if
 * the quadrant is not a leaf, which we have no means of knowing.  Still,
 * this case is sufficient to determine the processor ownership of a point.
 *
 * \note
 * This is a very powerful function that can become slow if not used carefully.
 *
 * \note
 * As with the two other search functions in this file, calling it once with
 * many points is generally much faster than calling it once for each point.
 * Using multiple points also allows for a per-quadrant termination of the
 * recursion in addition to a more costly per-point termination.
 *
 * \note
 * This function works fine when used for the special cases that either the
 * partition or the local quadrants are not of interest.  However, in the case
 * of querying only local information we expect that \ref p4est_search_local
 * will be faster since it employs specific local optimizations.

 *                          If the callback returns false, this quadrant and
 *                          its descendants are excluded from the search, and
 *                          the points in this branch are not queried further.
 *                          Its \b point argument is always NULL.
 *                          Callback may be NULL in which case it is ignored.
 * \param [in] point_fn     Executed once for each point that is relevant for a
 *                          quadrant of the search.  If it returns true, the
 *                          point is tracked further down that branch, else it
 *                          is discarded from the queries for the children.
 *                          If \b points is not NULL, this callback must be not
 *                          NULL.  If \b points is NULL, it is not called.
 * \param [in] points       User-defined array of points.  We do not interpret
 *                          a point, just pass it into the callbacks.
