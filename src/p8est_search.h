 * The search runs over all local quadrants and proceeds recursively top-down.
 * Its outer loop is thus a depth-first, processor-local forest traversal.
 * Each quadrant in that loop either is a leaf, or a (direct or indirect)
 * strict ancestor of a leaf.  On entering a new quadrant, a user-provided
 * quadrant-callback is executed.
 * The set of points that potentially matches a given quadrants diminishes from
 * the root down to the leaves:  For each quadrant, an inner loop over the
 * potentially matching points executes a point-callback for each candidate
 * that determines whether the point may be a match.  If not, it is discarded
 * immediately, otherwise it is passed to the next finer level.
 * The callback is allowed to return true for the same point and more than one
 * quadrant; in this case more than one matching quadrant may be identified.
 * The callback is also allowed to return false for all children of a quadrant
 * that it returned true for earlier.
 * The points can really be anything, p4est does not perform any
 * interpretation, just passes the pointer along to the callback function.
