/** \file p4est_connectivity.h
 *
 * The connectivity defines the coarse topology of the forest.
 *
 * A 2D forest consists of one or more quadtrees, each of which a logical
 * square.
 * Each tree has a local coordinate system, which defines the origin and the
 * direction of its x- and y-axes as well as the numbering of its faces and
 * corners.
 * Each tree may connect to any other tree (including itself) across any of
 * its faces and/or corners, where the neighbor may be arbitrarily rotated
 * and/or flipped.
 * The \ref p4est_connectivity data structure stores these connections.
 *
 * We impose the following requirement for consistency of \ref p4est_balance :
 *
 * \note If a connectivity implies natural connections between trees that
 * are corner neighbors without being face neighbors, these corners shall be
 * encoded explicitly in the connectivity.
 * Please see the documentation of \ref p4est_connectivity_t for the exact
 * encoding convention.
 *
 * We provide various predefined connectivitys by dedicated constructors,
 * such as
 *
 *  * \ref p4est_connectivity_new_unitsquare for the unit square,
 *  * \ref p4est_connectivity_new_periodic for the periodic unit square,
 *  * \ref p4est_connectivity_new_brick for a rectangular grid of trees,
 *  * \ref p4est_connectivity_new_moebius for a nonoriented loop of trees.

 * If a face is on the physical boundary it must connect to itself.
 *
 * The values for tree_to_face are 0..7

 * The orientation is 0 for faces that are mutually direction-aligned
 * and 1 for faces that are running in opposite directions.
 *
 * It is valid to specify num_vertices as 0.
 * In this case vertices and tree_to_vertex are set to NULL.
 * Otherwise the vertex coordinates are stored in the array vertices as
 * [0][0]..[0][2]..[num_vertices-1][0]..[num_vertices-1][2].
 * Vertex coordinates are optional and not used for inferring topology.
 *
 * The corners are stored when they connect trees that are not already face
 * neighbors at that specific corner.
 * In this case tree_to_corner indexes into \a ctt_offset.
 * Otherwise the tree_to_corner entry must be -1 and this corner is ignored.
 * If num_corners == 0, tree_to_corner and corner_to_* arrays are set to NULL.
 *
 * The arrays corner_to_* store a variable number of entries per corner.
 * For corner c these are at position [ctt_offset[c]]..[ctt_offset[c+1]-1].
 * Their number for corner c is ctt_offset[c+1] - ctt_offset[c].
 * The entries encode all trees adjacent to corner c.
 * The size of the corner_to_* arrays is num_ctt = ctt_offset[num_corners].
 *
 * The *_to_attr arrays may have arbitrary contents defined by the user.
 * We do not interpret them.
