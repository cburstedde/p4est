/** This structure holds the 3D inter-tree connectivity information.

 *
 * The arrays tree_to_* are stored in z ordering.
 * For corners the order wrt. zyx is 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111.
 * For faces the order is -x +x -y +y -z +z.
 * They are allocated [0][0]..[0][N-1]..[num_trees-1][0]..[num_trees-1][N-1].
 * where N is 6 for tree and face, 8 for corner, 12 for edge.
 *
 * The values for tree_to_face are in 0..23
 * where ttf % 6 gives the face number and ttf / 6 the face orientation code.
 * The orientation is determined as follows.  Let my_face and other_face
 * be the two face numbers of the connecting trees in 0..5.  Then the first
 * face corner of the lower of my_face and other_face connects to a face
 * corner numbered 0..3 in the higher of my_face and other_face.  The face
 * orientation is defined as this number.  If my_face == other_face, treating
 * either of both faces as the lower one leads to the same result.
 *
 * It is valid to specify num_vertices as 0.
 * In this case vertices and tree_to_vertex are set to NULL.
 * Otherwise the vertex coordinates are stored in the array vertices as
 * [0][0]..[0][2]..[num_vertices-1][0]..[num_vertices-1][2].
 *
 * The edges are only stored when they connect trees.
 * In this case tree_to_edge indexes into \a ett_offset.
 * Otherwise the tree_to_edge entry must be -1 and this edge is ignored.
 * If num_edges == 0, tree_to_edge and edge_to_* arrays are set to NULL.
 *
 * The arrays edge_to_* store a variable number of entries per edge.
 * For edge e these are at position [ett_offset[e]]..[ett_offset[e+1]-1].
 * Their number for edge e is ett_offset[e+1] - ett_offset[e].
 * The entries encode all trees adjacent to edge e.
 * The size of the edge_to_* arrays is num_ett = ett_offset[num_edges].
 * The edge_to_edge array holds values in 0..23, where the lower 12 indicate
 * one edge orientation and the higher 12 the opposite edge orientation.
 *
 * The corners are only stored when they connect trees.
 * In this case tree_to_corner indexes into \a ctt_offset.
 * Otherwise the tree_to_corner entry must be -1 and this corner is ignored.
 * If num_corners == 0, tree_to_corner and corner_to_* arrays are set to NULL.
 *
 * The arrays corner_to_* store a variable number of entries per corner.
 * For corner c these are at position [ctt_offset[c]]..[ctt_offset[c+1]-1].
 * Their number for corner c is ctt_offset[c+1] - ctt_offset[c].
 * The entries encode all trees adjacent to corner c.
 * The size of the corner_to_* arrays is num_ctt = ctt_offset[num_corners].
 *
 * The *_to_attr arrays may have arbitrary contents defined by the user.
