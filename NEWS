NEWS
====

 * We begin introducing #define for backwards compatibility queries.
   These defines are placed in src/p4est_base.h.
   Please see the paragraph COMPATIBLIITY below for a list.
   We will do the same in libsc; please see the NEWS file there.
   If your code does not compile after updating p4est, please modify it.
   The defines are reliable for the master branch, and usually for develop.
   Topic branches are not required to conform.
 * Our official tarballs are linked from http://www.p4est.org/.
   The archives generated by github will not work; see the README file.

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Compatibility #define variables in p4est_base.h:

 * P4EST_COMM_TRANSFER_NULL
   indicates that we do no longer access unneeded buffers in p4est_transfer_.
   This means that it is from now on allowed to pass NULL pointers when it is
   certain that we will not dereference them.  The conditions for this are
   defined in the doxygen comments in p4est_communication.h.
 * P4EST_CONN_DISK_PERIODIC
   indicaties that p4est_connectivity_new_disk now takes two int arguments.
   They act as bool variables to switch periodicity on across x, y boundaries.
   The call of p4est_wrap_new_disk has changed as well to two more arguments.
