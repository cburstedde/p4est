title: Introduce is_strict_ancestor
desc: |-
  Rename the current is_ancestor routine to is_strict_ancestor.
  Introduce an is_ancestor routine that allows for equality.
  This means that the meaning of the is_ancestor routine changes.
  Go through all of p4est to update the code accordingly.
  If we miss any of these occurrences that could be very bad.

    For maximum safety, what about switching to the new function names
    p4est_is_equal_or_ancestor, p4est_is_unequal/strict_ancestor?
