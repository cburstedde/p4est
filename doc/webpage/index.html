<p>
The <tt>p4est</tt> software library enables the dynamic management of
a collection of adaptive octrees, conveniently called a forest of
octrees.  <tt>p4est</tt> is designed to work in parallel and scales to
hundreds of thousands, even millions, of processor cores.
It is actively maintained and used by researchers worldwide.
</p>
<p>
<tt>p4est</tt> is free software released under GNU General Public Licence
version 2, or (at your option) any later version.
</p>
<p>
This website's development is tracked in a <a
href="https://www.github.com/p4est/p4est.github.io/">public git repository</a>.

<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>
Please see the <a href="https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est">github repository</a>
of <tt>p4est</tt> or download the
<a href="https://p4est.github.io/release/p4est-2.3.2.tar.gz">latest release tarball</a>.
The source comes with commented example programs and test cases.
You can also download
<a href="https://github.com/p4est/p4est.github.io/tree/master/release/">older
stable releases</a>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>p4est</tt> uses <tt>libsc</tt> written by the same authors and others
for basic helper functionality such as logging, array and
hash data structures, parallel statistics, and more.  <tt>libsc</tt>
also integrates the third-party libraries <tt>zlib</tt> and
<tt>lua</tt>.  <tt>libsc</tt> is
free software under LGPL v2.1 (or later) and hosted at
<a href="https://github.com/cburstedde/libsc">github</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please note that the so-called releases auto-generated by github do
<em>not</em> work (they are lacking the subdirectory sc and
some generated files).
