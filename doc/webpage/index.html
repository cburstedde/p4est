<h2><tt>p4est</tt>: Parallel AMR on Forests of Octrees</h2>

<p>
The <tt>p4est</tt> software library enables the dynamic management of
a collection of adaptive octrees, conveniently called a forest of
octrees.  <tt>p4est</tt> is designed to work in parallel and scale to
hundreds of thousands of processor cores.
We explain the concepts and algorithms behind <tt>p4est</tt> in this <a
href="http://burstedde.ins.uni-bonn.de/research/papers/BursteddeWilcoxGhattas11.pdf"
>article</a>.  If you use <tt>p4est</tt> for your publications, please cite

<tt>p4est</tt> uses <tt>libsc</tt> written by the same authors and others
for basic helper functionality such as logging, array and
hash data structures, parallel statistics, and more.  <tt>libsc</tt>
also integrates the third-party libraries <tt>zlib</tt> and
<tt>lua</tt>.  <tt>libsc</tt> is
free software under LGPL v2.1 (or later) and hosted under

The generic adaptive finite element software <a
href="http://www.dealii.org/">deal.II</a> now interfaces to
<tt>p4est</tt> to obtain distributed mesh information.  The corresponding
algorithms are described in this <a
