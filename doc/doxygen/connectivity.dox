/** \page connectivity The connectivity structure
 *
 * An overview of the connectivity structure.
 *
 * ## The basic idea and definition
 * p4est leverages structured octree grids for efficient highly-scalable
 * adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). At the same time p4est enables the user to
 * represent a general and possibly non-squared (2D), non-cubic (3D) domain.
 * This flexibility for the domain choice is achieved by using a forest of
 * quadtrees (2D) or octrees (3D) instead of a single tree.
 * The forest represents a coarse mesh topology where each tree
 * is a logical hypercube. To represent a general domain, we cover
 * the domain with a conforming mesh of (potentially mapped) squares (2D) or
 * cubes (3D). Each square (2D) or cube (3D) represents a quadtree (2D) or
 * octree (3D) root. These trees are connected with respect to their root's
 * topological entities, i.e. in 2D corners and faces and in 3D corners, faces
 * and edges. This coarsest possible mesh is defined as the connectivity of a
 * forest.
 * It can not be changed during a simulation and in particular it can not be
 * coarsened further.
 *
 * ## Guidelines for connectivity design
 * Since the connectivity can not be changed during a simulation it should be
 * designed carefully. A few guidelines (replace cube(s) by square(s) for 2D)
 * are:
 * 1. Use as many cubes as needed to capture the domain's topology (connected
 *    components, holes, tunnels, etc.).
 * 2. Invest some more cubes to achieve an ideally uniform individual aspect
 *    ratio of each cube.
 * 3. Invest some more cubes if the distortion in any single mapped octree
 *    appears too large.
 * 4. Reduce the number of trees if the coarse mesh must be limited for
 *    numerical reasons.
 *
 * We have successfully connected millions of trees. Below 100k, there is no
 * need to even think about reducing their number if the procedure would not be
 * obvious.
 *
 * ## Constructing the connectivity
 * The easiest way to create a connectivity is to use  one of the
 * predefined functions in \ref p4est_connectivity.h (2D) or \ref
 * p8est_connectivity.h (3D). These predefined functions
 * `p4est_connectivity_new_*` (2D) and `p8est_connectivity_new_*` (3D) implement
 * some basic connectivities like a unit square (\ref
 * p4est_connectivity_new_unitsquare) or a unit cube (\ref
 * p8est_connectivity_new_unitcube) but also more advanced connectivities like
 * an icosahedron (\ref p4est_connectivity_new_icosahedron) or a 3D torus (\ref
 * p8est_connectivity_new_torus).
 *
 * Moreover, we want to point to the possibility of connecting topological
 * entities inside a single tree. This means that one can create periodic
 * connectivities, e.g. \ref p4est_connectivity_new_periodic (2D) and \ref
 * p8est_connectivity_new_periodic (3D).
 *
 * We also offer the functions \ref p4est_connectivity_read_inp (2D) and \ref
 * p8est_connectivity_read_inp (3D) to read a connectivity from an Abaqus
 * `.inp` file.
 *
 * The user can also create a new connectivity by allocating and populating
 * the connectivity structure using \ref p4est_connectivity_new_copy (2D) or
 * \ref p8est_connectivity_new_copy (3D). See the next section and \ref
 * p4est_connectivity_t (2D) or \ref p8est_connectivity_t (3D) for more
 * information on the elements of the connectivity structure.
 *
 * ## The connectivity data structure
 * The connectivity data structure (cf. \ref p4est_connectivity_t (2D), \ref
 * p8est_connectivity_t (3D)) is a public struct with documented entries and it is
 * independent of the MPI rank and hence must be the same on all MPI ranks.
 *
 * You may build any numbers of forests with the same connectivity object, but
 * the connectivity object must be destroyed only after the last of the forests
 * has been freed and the connectivity object must definitely be destroyed
 * (\ref p4est_connectivity_destroy (2D), \ref p8est_connectivity_destroy (3D)).
 *
 * ### Elements of the connectivity
 * The connectivity data structure consists of arrays and counts of different
 * entities.
 * In particular, the connectivity data structure contains the number
 * of trees [num_trees](\ref p4est_connectivity_t::num_trees) and the number of
 * vertices [num_vertices](\ref p4est_connectivity_t::num_vertices).
 * The vertices are stored in the double array
 * [vertices](\ref p4est_connectivity_t::vertices).
 * It is important to note
 * that the vertices are always points in the three-dimensional space; even in
 * the [2D connectivity](\ref p4est_connectivity_t).
 * The [vertices](\ref p4est_connectivity_t::vertices) are used to embed each
 * tree into the three-dimensional space in the array
 * [tree_to_vertex](\ref p4est_connectivity_t::tree_to_vertex). This embedding
 * is for example used for visualization (cf. \ref p4est_vtk.h
 * (2D), \ref p8est_vtk.h (3D)) or a custom transformation from tree-local
 * coordinates to a user-defined physical space (cf. \ref
 * p4est_geometry_new_connectivity (2D), \ref p8est_geometry_new_connectivity
 * (3D)).
 * The remaining counts in the connectivity structure are the number of
 * different topological entities that help to define the coarse mesh:
 * The [num_corners](\ref p4est_connectivity_t::num_corners) is the number of
 * corners that are not part of a face neighborhood (or edge neighborhood in
 * [3D](\ref p8est_connectivity_t::num_corners)) but connect trees.
 * Similarly, we have [num_edges](\ref p8est_connectivity_t::num_edges) in
 * addition in 3D -- storing the number of edges that are not part of a face
 * neighborhood but connect trees.
 * Then arrays like [tree_to_tree](\ref p4est_connectivity_t::tree_to_tree) and
 * [tree_to_face](\ref p4est_connectivity_t::tree_to_face) encode the inter-tree
 * connectivity information. For more information of the encoding in these
 * arrays and the other arrays see the documentation of \ref
 * p4est_connectivity_t (2D) and \ref p8est_connectivity_t (3D) and the
 * documentation of the respective elements of these two structures.
 *
 * ## Find more information
 * For information on further connectivity functionalities we refer to \ref
 * p4est_connectivity.h (2D) and \ref p8est_connectivity.h (3D).
 * In particular, you can find there functions for
 * [writing](\ref p4est_connectivity_save) and
 * [reading](\ref p4est_connectivity_load) a connectivity in a p4est internal
 * file format.
 * There are also functions to manipulate connectivity objects, e.g. one
 * can use METIS -- if it is available -- to
 * [reorder](\ref p4est_connectivity_reorder) a connectivity.
 *
 * ## Example of connectivity usage
 * An example of using various predefined connectivities can be found in
 * \ref simple/simple2.c (2D) and \ref simple/simple3.c (3D).
