# Release notes for the p4est software library

## General

 - We have been reminded, for good reason, to maintain release notes.
 - Please record explicitly if there have been any breaking changes wrt. the
   software API or ABI.  In this case, we'll bump the libtool version with
   the next release version.  Please also note if there have been A*I
   extensions, in which case we'll bump the libtool minor version.
