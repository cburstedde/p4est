## List of proposed p4est and libsc API changes

### Backards compatible

1.  Increase maximum level in 3D to 30.
1.  Extend the fix for neighborhood_owned to take a btype.
1.  Merge all mesh_edge changes to complete the file.

### Not backwards compatible

Fairly certain:

1.  Merge the removal of comm attributes in sc_init.
1.  Check that refine and coarsen_ext call their callback exactly once
    for every quadrant (if not operated recursively).
1.  Make p4est_refine/coarsen_ext call the replace callback
    if and only if the refine/coarsen callback returns 1.
    Allow for num_incoming = num_outgoing = 1.
1.  Rename the p4est_search functions as in branch p4est_search.
1.  Retire to the attic:
    -   p4est_wrap
    -   pdest
    -   sc_ranges

Undecided:

1.  Remove the min and max levels from the p4est data structures.
1.  Only store non-empty local trees.
1.  Remove autoconf logic for Fortran and C++ as well as the
    blas, lapack, and dmatrix code in libsc.
1.  Call the weight function for partitioning when mpisize == 1.
