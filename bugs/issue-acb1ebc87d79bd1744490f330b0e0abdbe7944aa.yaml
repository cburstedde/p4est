title: Write VTK output into one partition-independent .vtu file
desc: |-
  Currently each processor writes one .vtu file.  This is not practicable
  for large numbers of processors.  We can instead use MPI I/O to create
  only one (or a smaller number of) .vtu files that appear to have been
  written by one (or few) processes.
