title: Introduce is_strict_ancestor
desc: |-
  Rename the current is_ancestor routine to is_strict_ancestor.
  Introduce an is_ancestor routine that allows for equality.
  This means that the meaning of the is_ancestor routine changes.
  Go through all of p4est to update the code accordingly.
  If we miss any of these occurrences that could be very bad.
