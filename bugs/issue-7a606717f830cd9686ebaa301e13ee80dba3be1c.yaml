title: Fix p4est_comm_neighborhood_owned
desc: |-
  The full_tree variables only cover tree face neighbors.
  For some connectivities, there may only be tree edge or corner neighbors.
  In this case, p4est_comm_neighborhood_owned may return a false positive.
  We should also document that it may return a false negative.
